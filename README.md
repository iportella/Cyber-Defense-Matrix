# Cyber-Defense-Matrix
The **Cyber Defense Matrix (CDM)** is an innovative framework that merges the concepts of MITRE ATT&CK and the Cyber Kill Chain to provide a comprehensive, matrix view of cyber defense processes.

Designed to assist organizations in understanding, monitoring, and effectively combating cyber threats, the CDM enables quick identification and response to adversary activities, following a logical sequence that mirrors a cyber adversary's attack process.

The CDM is divided into seven main stages: Strategic Probing, Artifice Assembly, Stealth Strike, Presence Consolidation, Spreading the Plague, Covert Command, and Final Foothold. Each stage is associated with best practices in cyber security to strengthen the organization's defense against potential attacks.

The primary aim of the CDM is to provide a structured and comprehensive view of cyber security, enabling organizations to adequately prepare for the constantly evolving threats in the cyber landscape. By adopting the CDM, organizations will be well-positioned to detect, mitigate, and respond to security incidents effectively and efficiently.
