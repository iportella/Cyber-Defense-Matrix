1. Strategic Probing:

Open Source Monitoring: Actively monitor open sources to identify potential threats and develop threat intelligence.
Security Awareness Training: Ensure all members of the organization are aware of potential threats and know how to report them.
2. Artifice Assembly:

Antimalware Software: Utilize up-to-date and effective antimalware software to identify and neutralize potential threats.
Patching and Updates: Keep all operating systems and applications updated to avoid known vulnerabilities.
3. Stealth Strike:

Email Filtering: Use email filtering tools to block potential attack vectors, like malicious email attachments.
Access Control: Implement strict access controls to limit the execution of unknown programs.
4. Presence Consolidation:

Secure Configuration: Ensure all systems and applications are securely configured to minimize exploitation opportunities.
Network Monitoring: Use anomaly detection and network monitoring to identify suspicious activities.
5. Spreading the Plague:

Principle of Least Privilege: Apply the principle of least privilege to limit what a user or process can do, thereby minimizing an attacker's ability to escalate privileges.
Logging and Monitoring: Maintain detailed records of activities to facilitate detection and investigation of suspicious activities.
6. Covert Command:

Network Segmentation: Use network segmentation to isolate parts of the network and make lateral movement more difficult for attackers.
Outbound Filtering: Control and monitor outbound communication to detect communication with command-and-control servers.
7. Final Foothold:

Incident Response: Have an incident response plan ready for quick action when a breach is detected.
Disaster Recovery: Plan how you will recover from an attack, including regular and tested backups.
