**1. Strategic Probing:**
  - Open Source Monitoring: Actively monitor open sources to identify potential threats and develop threat intelligence.
  - Security Awareness Training: Ensure all members of the organization are aware of potential threats and know how to report them.

**2. Artifice Assembly:**
  - Antimalware Software: Utilize up-to-date and effective antimalware software to identify and neutralize potential threats.
  - Patching and Updates: Keep all operating systems and applications updated to avoid known vulnerabilities.

**3. Stealth Strike:**
  - Email Filtering: Use email filtering tools to block potential attack vectors, like malicious email attachments.
  - Access Control: Implement strict access controls to limit the execution of unknown programs.

**4. Presence Consolidation:**
  - Secure Configuration: Ensure all systems and applications are securely configured to minimize exploitation opportunities.
  - Network Monitoring: Use anomaly detection and network monitoring to identify suspicious activities.

**5. Spreading the Plague:**
  - Principle of Least Privilege: Apply the principle of least privilege to limit what a user or process can do, thereby minimizing an attacker's ability to escalate privileges.
  - Logging and Monitoring: Maintain detailed records of activities to facilitate detection and investigation of suspicious activities.

**6. Covert Command:**
  - Network Segmentation: Use network segmentation to isolate parts of the network and make lateral movement more difficult for attackers.
  - Outbound Filtering: Control and monitor outbound communication to detect communication with command-and-control servers.

**7. Final Foothold:**
  - Incident Response: Have an incident response plan ready for quick action when a breach is detected.
  - Disaster Recovery: Plan how you will recover from an attack, including regular and tested backups.
