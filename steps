**1. Strategic Probing:** In this phase, the adversary is attempting to gather information about the target. Various ATT&CK techniques can be used, such as open-source information gathering (T1596) and social network information gathering (T1590).

**Rationale:** It's important to recognize this stage in order to identify potential threats and bolster defense in areas that could be targeted.

**2. Artifice Assembly:** Here, the attacker is preparing for the attack, whether by creating malware or spear-phishing. ATT&CK techniques like Malicious Software (T1583) and Spearphishing (T1566) can be employed.

**Rationale:** Understanding this phase can aid in identifying the specific techniques an adversary may use, allowing for more effective defense.

**3. Stealth Strike:** At this stage, the attacker delivers the attack vector. In the case of ATT&CK, it would be the execution of the attack, such as running a malicious script or executable (T1059).

**Rationale:** Recognizing the delivery phase allows for the isolation and handling of attack vectors.

**4. Persistence Prowl:** In the Kill Chain, exploitation occurs when the attack begins to take effect. In ATT&CK, it's the stage of ensuring that the attack continues to operate, like running scripts at logon (T1037).

**Rationale:** Understanding how an attacker maintains their presence on a system is critical for the complete removal of a threat.

**5. Spreading the Plague:** In this phase, the malware is installed. In ATT&CK, this could be seen as escalating privileges or evading detection, such as Access Control Evasion Abuse (T1562).

**Rationale:** This stage is critical to understanding how an attacker consolidates themselves on a system.

**6. Covert Command:** This phase involves the remote control of the compromised system. ATT&CK techniques could include common network protocols (T1071) or transferring data to adversary-controlled servers (T1041).

**Rationale:** This helps identify how attackers control compromised systems.

**7. Final Foothold:** Finally, the adversary carries out the desired action, whether it's data theft, destruction, or another action. In ATT&CK, this would be the final impact of the attack, such as service disruption (T1491) or data theft (T1020).

**Rationale:** Understanding this phase can aid in measuring the extent of damage and can be helpful in recovery following an attack.
